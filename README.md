MQTT script for the task of the microcontroller system course at UNJANI UNIVERSITY. ðŸ¤˜

MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. 
It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. 
It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. 

For example, it has been used in sensors communicating to a broker via satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small device scenarios.
